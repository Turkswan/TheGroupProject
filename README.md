This is the team project.
Redirect Output to a File:  Redirect the output of the ls command (listing files in the /home directory) toafile called directory_listing.txt.  Append the output of df -h (disk usage) to the directory_listing.txt file.  Use input redirection to display the contents of directory_listing.txt using thecat
command.  Pipe the output of ps aux into grep to filter processes related to ssh.  Redirect both the standard output and error of a command (e.g., ls
/nonexistent_directory) to a file called errors.txt. o Display detailed system information, such as the kernel version, CPU architecture, andRAM size. o View the system logs to check for recent events or errors made.
